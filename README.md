# pj-ltc-756978 #
Project to track the leetcode challenges that I am doing and store the environment.

# directory structure #
The first level is for the environment that the challenges are done in. In each environment directory there will be a `_bp` directory. When starting a new challenge duplicate this and work in there for the rest of the time.

# challenge readme #
There will be an example readme for you to fill out in the boilerplate. Fill out the following fields for the specific challenges:
1. Name of the challenge
2. URL
3. Brief description
4. Link to Notion page

> The majority of the content, if there is anything, will be found in the Notion page. This is easy to edit, share, and pull in data from other sources.

# version control #
In terms of version control, create a branch for each challenge that you are working on. I used to think that you will have branches for each environment, but this would have gotten out of control pretty quickly. Rather than doing that, I think create branches from master, choose an environment to work in, and then only merge back into master if you have completed the challenge.
